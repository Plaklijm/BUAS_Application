# BUAS_Application

Application for the BUAS

Simple game made in C++ using SDL2

This project was based upon a template given by the BUAS and made with the theme "Collect" in mind

Controls:
AD to move, W to push/pull while moving, Space to jump/doublejump, LShift for walking/inAir control and Esc for pause

Collect all the small planets in order to advance to the next level. You can move blocks to change the level to your need.
Jump into the portal when you have every planet collected in the level in order to go to the next one. Have fun :D 

^All of it is also explained in the game itself.
